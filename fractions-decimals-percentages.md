## **British Agricultural Theme: Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages**

### **Section 1: Fractions**

_Fractions are everywhere, even on the farm! Whether it’s splitting hay bales among cows or sharing the carrot harvest among rabbits, understanding fractions is key to a farmer’s day-to-day work._

#### Questions:

**Q1:** Farmer Joe has 16 cows, and he needs to split them into groups of \(\frac{1}{4}\). How many cows are in each group?

**Q2:** A hen laid 20 eggs, and Farmer Beth gave \(\frac{3}{5}\) of them to her neighbour. How many eggs did she give away?

**Q3:** A field is \(\frac{3}{4}\) covered with wheat, and the rest is covered with barley. What fraction of the field is covered with barley?

**Q4:** Out of 120 sheep, Farmer Smith sold \(\frac{1}{6}\) of them. How many sheep did he sell?

**Q5:** A cheese wheel is cut into 12 slices. If Farmer Nancy’s cat eats \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the cheese wheel, how many slices does it eat?

**Q6:** Farmer Tim harvested 45 pumpkins and sold \(\frac{2}{9}\) of them at the market. How many pumpkins did he sell?

**Q7:** Farmer Chloe divides her 40 hectares of land into equal parts, planting wheat on \(\frac{5}{8}\) of it. How many hectares are planted with wheat?

**Q8:** A scarecrow must guard \(\frac{2}{5}\) of a field that is 50 square metres. How many square metres does the scarecrow watch over?

**Q9:** Out of 180 apples, \(\frac{7}{9}\) are turned into cider. How many apples are used for cider?

### **Section 2: Decimals**

_Farmers deal with decimals when weighing crops or measuring out milk. Let’s ensure you can handle these as smoothly as a farmer counting sheep (or counting how many sheep are left after falling asleep)._

#### Questions:

**Q11:** A jar of honey weighs 1.75 kg. If Farmer Pete’s bee colony produces 15 jars, what is the total weight of honey produced in kilograms?

**Q12:** A litre of milk costs £0.95, and Farmer Daisy sells 120 litres. How much revenue does she earn?

**Q13:** Farmer Will’s tractor covers 8.5 km per hour. How many kilometres will it cover in 5.2 hours?

**Q14:** A bag of potatoes weighs 2.4 kg. Farmer Lucy stacks 18 of these bags. What is the total weight of the stacked potatoes?

**Q15:** Farmer Bob has 9.75 metres of rope. He uses 3.2 metres for securing a gate. How much rope does he have left?

**Q16:** Farmer Ella finds that a chicken eats 0.075 kg of feed per day. How much feed will 20 chickens consume in a day?

**Q17:** A tractor tyre’s circumference is 2.35 m. How far will it travel after 30 full rotations?

**Q18:** A 5-litre watering can is filled with 3.65 litres of water. How much more water can it hold?

**Q19:** Farmer Jamie fills 0.45 litres of milk into small bottles. How many bottles can be filled from 10 litres of milk?

**Q20:** Farmer Kelly finds that 0.85 of her vegetable patch is lettuce and the rest is carrots. What decimal represents the part covered by carrots?

### **Section 3: Percentages**

_Percentages help farmers manage everything from crop yields to animal feed ratios. Let’s dig into this field of study!_

#### Questions:

**Q21:** Farmer Harry harvested 200 kg of apples, and 30% were sold at the market. How many kilograms were sold?

**Q22:** A farm shop’s revenue increased by 15% from £2,000 last month. What is this month’s revenue?

**Q23:** Farmer Sue’s field produces 500 kg of wheat. If 12% is stored for future planting, how many kilograms are stored?

**Q24:** A pumpkin weighs 9 kg, and it loses 10% of its weight after drying. What is its weight after drying?

**Q25:** Farmer Leo’s chicken farm produced 1,000 eggs last week, but only 85% were sold. How many eggs were sold?

**Q26:** A tractor that used to cost £15,000 has been discounted by 20%. What is the new price?

**Q27:** Farmer Mia receives 450 reviews for her farm shop, and 92% are positive. How many positive reviews did she get?

**Q28:** The farm expands by 25% from its original 80 hectares. What is the new size of the farm?
